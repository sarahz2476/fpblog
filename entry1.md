#### For many of my reseach I use [www.encyclopedia.com] (https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/law/law/forensic-science)
Today I researched about the important events about how forensic came to be. The earliest known forensic science is archimedes some in the 287 - 212 bc. He figured out the king’s crown was not made out of gold. I’ve also learned that identical twins have different fingerprints. I was shocked to find out that the first crime analysis opened up in Los Angeles because this state is portrayed more as like a really outgoing state. Plus many celebs live there as hollywood is also there.

Today I researched about they ways a deadbody and crime scene can be anaylze to help a murder case. A murder will alway have some kind of mark left behind. Following these breadcrumbs can help investigators get a closer gap to solving a case. For Example, autopsies can help police find marks left behind or aleast get a clue on how the murder kills and it can help build a profile of the nurder from it. Id the crime scene is the the place where the murder takes place and there is marks left behind that only one person took the action and no drag marks, the police will know the nurderer has to be someone strong enough to carry the dead body. Or if there were drag marks, the murderer is probably not strong enough. Overall, the info I found today were really interesting.

I wrote about some important forensic scientists. There was Edmond who basically started the idea of forensic scientist, Koff a female scientist who solved many crimes through her ability to study bones and Lee who came up with the idea to make mini replica of a crime scene. This helped detectives strengthen their skills. His replicas include extreme small and little detail and is very explicit. I’m up to the researching part. I think I am almost finished. I don’t really know what to add but I feel like something is missing and I don't know what though.

Today, I tried to set my IDE up for gathering all my research. I technially didn't really learn anything but I was able to practice my skills og cloning, forking, etc. I use IDE, github, and google classroom and document to help me complete today's task. A skill I learn managing time.
